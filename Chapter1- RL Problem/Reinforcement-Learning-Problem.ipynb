    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reinforcement Learning (RL) is concerned with goal-directed learning and decision-making.\n",
    "- In RL an agent learns from experiences it gains by interacting with the environment. In Supervised Learning we cannot affect the environment.\n",
    "- In RL rewards are often delayed in time and the agent tries to maximize a long-term goal. For example, one may need to make seemingly suboptimal moves to reach a winning position in a game.\n",
    "- An agent interacts with the environment via states, actions and rewards.\n",
